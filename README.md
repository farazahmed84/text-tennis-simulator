### Strategies:
1 = Aggressive baseliner
2 = Defensive baseliner
3 = Serve and Volley
4 = All court player

(Federer is an all court player in the above example.)

By picking the above strategies, the players will play the shots they are best in.  
For example, if you pick 'Serve and Volley', players will play the other shots if  
they are forced to by an opponent, but whenever they can, they will try to play  
more volleys instead of other shots.

### Skills:
For skills, use a number from 0â€“100.  
Higher the number, higher the skills.
